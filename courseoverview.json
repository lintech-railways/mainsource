        "jobprofile": "Railway Training Institute has a rich history as being one of the oldest training institutions in the East African region dating back to the colonial era. The institute was set up to meet the increasing demand for skilled workforce required to manage the East African railways and harbors. On June 29, 1956, Fredrick Crowford, Deputy Governor of Kenya unveiled the plaque to inaugurate the institute as a center for developing human resources for the East African Railways. Upon dissolution of the then East African Railways and harbors in 1976 the institute became under full ownership of the Kenya Railways Corporation and focused exclusively on railway courses as a means of meeting the technical skills required to manage the Kenya railways systems in the country. However, upon an extensive feasibility study in the year 1988, a decision was arrived that the capacity of the institute was grossly under-utilized. It was then that the institute launched commercial courses in Engineering, Business Management, and Hospitality. These elaborate efforts at expansion earned the institute recognition from the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology. Progressive improvement in academic performance and demand for quality training has led the institution to further diversify its academic courses to include Marine Courses and revamped rail curricular."
